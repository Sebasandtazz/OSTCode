# OSTCode
This is the code (and maybe the board files) for the SmartTrigPi Project. I have included the SCPI parser thanks to Chris Tan.

In addition to this code, I have included the pymeasure compatible library created smarttrigpi.py. This would have to be added
to the pymeasure library.

The following libraries are needed on the Pi, it's possible I will make a package to install all of these, but if not:

lgpio -> 

board -> 

digitalio -> 

adafruit_rgb_display.st7789 -> 

PIL -> sudo apt install i think
